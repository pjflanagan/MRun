			<p class="p1">...MRun is the running club at the University of Michigan. One of the founding clubs in the club running scene, MRun has since been a dominant force. Since its inception in 2004, the club has grown to a membership of over 200 dues-paying undergraduate and graduate students. This makes MRun not only the biggest, most popular, and fastest growing club on campus, but also the largest collegiate running club in the nation. Racing in varsity and club Cross Country and Track and Field meets across the Midwest, MRun is very competitive within collegiate running. The MRun men were national champions at the 2010 NIRCA Cross Country Championships meet, while the women completed the same feat in 2008. The MRun men and women have had top-five finishes within the NCTFA National Track and Field meet. Members of the club win races at the 5k, 10k, and marathon distances. MRun also caters to track and field athletes and has year-round training for sprinters and field competitors. Because MRun competes in indoor and outdoor track, distance, sprint, and field event track athletes are able to travel around the country and compete in a long winter and spring season against club and varsity athletes.</p>
			<p id="p2">Although MRun is very competitive, it accomodates all types of runners, and thus all ability levels are welcome. There are no cuts, try-outs, or time trials to join the club. Whether you wish to compete against colleges nationwide, run in actual varsity races, or just show up a few times a week and run with friends, MRun is the right club for you. MRun provides more than just an outlet for running; it is also a large charitable organization, deeply involved within the community. This year alone the club as a whole raised over $11,000 for various local and national charities, including: Special Olympics, The American Cancer Society, and myTeam Triumph. MRun also provides a very social atmosphere which is inviting to newcomers.</p>

				<p class="p1">In the fall, MRun competes in National Intercollegiate Running Club Association (NIRCA) cross country races. There are no tryouts, cuts, or qualifying times for the team, so anyone who wants to race is welcome! Most races are 8k for men and 6k for women, with a few 5k races sprinkled in.</p>
				<p>MRun travels to several local NIRCA meets in the fall, as well as a select few collegiate varsity races. See the schedules tab for more information on races.</p>
				<p>MRun enjoys a reputation as one of the most competitive clubs in the nation. The men and women have finished very well in the National Championships every year since the inception of NIRCA. The women were National Champions in 2008, while the men's team brought home the gold in 2010.</p>
