	<p class="p1">The Running Club participates in the U of M Relay for Life, a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society held at Palmer Field in April of each year. The idea is for every team to have someone walking around the track at all times, but naturally, as a running club, we run around the track for all 24 hours! In 2011, we walked/ran 530 miles in 24 hours. And while not running, we are singing karaoke, competing in basketball and dodgeball tournaments, and generally having a grand old time. For our spirit and dedication to the event, we have received the Most Spirited Team Award at Relay for Life in 2008, 2009, and 2010. But most importantly, through Saturday-night bake sales, on-site fundraisers (pie in the face, anyone?) and individual fundraising, we have raised over $10,000 for cancer research through the years.</p>
