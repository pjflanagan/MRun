	<p class="p1">Race Across Michigan is an annual charity relay run beginning in Detroit along the Detroit River and finishing 182 miles west on the coast of Lake Michigan. A group of running club members cover the distance as a relay race with some members running up to 20 miles over the course of the race. Our team goal is to cover the entire distance in under 24 hours while raising money for the Special Olympics of Michigan. The event has raised over $1,500 each year and in 2013 we raised over $18,000! The event started in 2009, and has grown steadily over the years.</p>
