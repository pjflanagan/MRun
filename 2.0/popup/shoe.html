	<p class="p1">MRun hosts an annual shoe drive at the NIRCA Cross Country National Championships meet. We arrange for running clubs from across the country to bring old shoes with them to the meet and have them donated to local homeless shelters. We have a friendly competition between the clubs to see who can donate the most shoes. Since the program's inception in 2008, we have put hundreds of pairs of shoes on needy feet.</p>
