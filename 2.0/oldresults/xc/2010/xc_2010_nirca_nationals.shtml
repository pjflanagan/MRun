<h1>MRun Men are National Champions!</h1><br />
<p>Men take 1st  place at NIRCA Cross Country National Championships<br /><br />

On Saturday, November  14th, members of the Michigan Running Club put on their spikes for  the last cross country meet of the season- the NIRCA Cross Country National  Championships. Collegiate teams from all across the country traveled to the  event, which was held in Bloomington, Indiana at Indiana University. Going into  the race, the MRun men were only ranked 8th in the country, but they  were finally able to showcase all of their hard-work and talent at Nationals.  Not only did the men take 1st place out of 35 teams, but also had three runners  in the top 10, including Duriel Hardy, who won the individual race. The women’s  team finished in 10th place. Mollie Pozolo make first team  all-American, with an impressive 11th place finish.<br /><br />

Hardy finished the  men’s 8K race in 25:54, 20 seconds ahead of the 2nd place finisher. The 3rd  male to cross the finish line, also from MRun, was senior Nathan Peters, with a  time of 26:00. This was Peters 4th year in the top 10 at NIRCA  National Championships. The 3rd male from the Michigan Running Club  to make first team all-American was Max Hock (10th place, 26:39).  Finishing close behind Hock and rounding out the scorers for the men’s team  were Joseph Billian (17th place, 26:56) and Alex Prasad (32nd place,  27:13).<br /><br />

Mollie Pozolo, finished  the women’s 6K in 22:57, only 2 seconds behind the 10th place  finisher. Despite missing some of their top-finishers from previous meets of  the season, the ladies’ team still finished strong as individual women stepped  up to the plate. The second MRunner to cross the finish line was Whitney  Gorris, with at time of 25:49. Following right behind her, at 25:52, was Katie  Grassa. Soon after Grassa, Lindsay Doherty (26:14) and Melanie Jackson (26:16)  finished within seconds of each other.<br /><br />

This is the first  time that the Michigan Running Club’s men’s team has been National Champions.  This is also the first time that the club has had 4 individuals make the  all-American first team. The race was a great way to end the season and show  the rest of the country how hard MRun has been training all semester. After  some well-deserved time off, MRun will begin its track season that will  continue throughout the winter and spring.<br /><br />
