  On September 11th,  the Michigan Running Club attended its first meet of the fall cross country  season, the varsity collegiate Detroit Titan Invite.  12 men and 2 women attended the meet,  competing with several NCAA teams and several community college teams.<br /><br />
  
Mollie Pozolo, who ran  19:58 on a hilly 5k course for 15th overall, led the women’s contingent.  After her was Lindsay Doherty, who finished  32nd overall with a time of 21:45.<br /><br />

The men finished 4th  in the collegiate 4-mile race on the challenging Cass Benton course.  The men had 125 points, behind Eastern  Michigan (41), Wayne State (48), and U of D Mercy (56).  Nathan Peters was the first MRunner across  the line at 21:23, good for 21st place.  Max Hock (21:31) was right on his heels in 23rd  place, while Joe Billian made his MRun debut with a 26th place  finish at 21:37.  Rounding out the the  scoring were Jimmy Adams (42nd place, 22:27) and Jason Mahakian (44th  place, 22:29).<br /><br />

A lucky few without  Friday class will attend the Spartan Invitational in East Lansing, MI on  September 17, before opening their NIRCA cross country campaign on September 26th  with the Michigan Fall Classic.<br /><br />
