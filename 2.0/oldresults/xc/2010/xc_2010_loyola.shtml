Despite the cold  conditions of rain and brutal winds in the “Windy City”, MRun still took first  place in both the men’s and women’s races. A total of 16 women and 31 men made  the trip to Chicago to compete in the race. Following their strong performances  at the Michigan Fall Classic as individual winners, Nathan Peters and Mackenzie  Adams were again the first individuals to cross the finish line. Peters  finished the men’s 8K race in, and Adams finished the women’s 5K in 19:50. <br /><br />

Following closely  behind Mackenzie Adams, Christina Capriccioso made her debut in MRun with a 3rd  place finish (20:30). Despite an ongoing injury, Erica Christensen had another  solid performance, coming in 12th place (20:35). Also competing in  their first races with MRun, Whitney Goris (21:09, 14th place) and  Claire Wieczorek (21:21, 18th place) rounded out the scoring  contingent for the women’s team. The women finished with a total of 42 points,  far ahead of CMU (76) and Illinois (86). <br /><br />

The men’s team had a  strong pack at the head of the race throughout most of the 8k.  Although Peters took the lead at the end of  the race, Max Hock (26:52, 3rd place) and Joe Billian (27:00,4th  place) also had extremely strong performances. The next batch of MRunners to  cross the finish line all came within a minute of each other- Justin Waraniak  (27:17, 7th), Alex Prasad (27:23, 8th), Will Kane  (27:54,9th), Jimmy Adams (10th, 27:55), and Jason Mahakian (28:03,  12th). The men accumulated an impressively low 23 points, far ahead  of Illionois (65) and Purdue (78). A total of 31 men competed in the race. <br /><br />

On Friday, October 9th,  a select group of MRunners will be heading to Rochester, MI for the Michigan  Intercollegiate meet, and competing in the open race. Mrun will also be heading  to CMU on Saturday, October 16th for a 5K. <br /><br />
