“I didn’t know it was possible,” the race announcer exclaimed before announcing the team awards.  The University of Michigan women’s 
team won the meet, and left a tough to beat legacy, scoring only 17 points—the lowest score ever achieved by a team in the history of this invitational!<br /><br />

Leading the team and winning the meet was MRun’s junior Mollie Pozolo, in a time of 19:59.  She was the only female athlete to break the 20-minute barrier.  
Second in the meet (and also MRun) was freshmen Caci Dishman, finishing just behind Mollie in a time of 20:02.  Caci led nearly the entire race and held strong at 
the finish, but had some navigational issues near the finish.  It is clear that these two girls are going to be essential aspects of MRun’s women’s team through
the year.

Rounding out the top 7 for the women were Natasha Boruszok (3rd, 20:19), Billie Fierros (5th, 20:41), Lindsay Doherty (6th, 20:42), Michelle Lapin (9th, 21:06),
and Kaylee VanDommelen (10th, 21:16). The women’s team dominated the medal-earning competition, receiving 12 of the 15 medals, along with the championship trophy.<br /><br />

Just 45 minutes before this historic event took place, MRun’s men team had broken that same record, scoring 18 points in their race!  
Leading the men was MRun’s Garrett Cullen (16:24), followed by Joshua Partridge (16:26).  Rounding out the men’s team was Thomas Noel (4th, 16:34), 
Jimmy Adams (5th, 16:39), Justin Waraniak (6th, 16:48), Ari Schorr (7th, 16:56) and Joseph Porcari (8th, 17:00).  The MRun men took home 10 of the 15 medals.<br /><br />

The men’s race played out differently than the women’s.  Whereas the women’s race was led by Mollie and Caci, the men’s race had a pack of 5 that 
stuck with each other for most of the race, thinning out as Garrett led the kick down the homestretch through the last ¼ mile of the race.<br /><br />

Great work, MRun! <br /><br />
