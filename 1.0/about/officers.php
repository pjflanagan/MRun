				<p>Hi! I'm a junior studying Mechanical Engineering, and I love being outdoors, having conversations, meeting new people, and, of course, running. As your president for the 2014-2015 school year, it's my job to make sure that you have fun! Whether you thought about joining the varsity team or you've never run more than a few miles in your life, I guarantee MRun is the club for you! If you have any questions about the club, running, engineering, or anything else, just ask!</p>

				<p>Hey guys! My name is Acacia Frances Dishman, more commonly known as Caci Dishpun, MRun Mom, queen of puns, M.D.. But actually just call me Caci. A little bit about me, I'm from Dexter, Michigan and have been a giant U of M fan my entire life. So being elected vice pres of the university's biggest club sports team (HOLLA) really BLUE my mind. Hah. Hah. I'm a senior in LSA, majoring in biophysics- because why not have two sciences in the name of your major? I love to run and love MRun even more. As your vice president, I keep in contact with Alumni, manage Maize Pages, and basically act as a second president by welcoming new members and leading the club. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or puns, email me at adishman@umich.edu, friend me on facebook, snapchat me (cacidish) or just come to practice! I can't wait to go running with y'all!</p>

				<p>Hi MRun! I'm Rob Rose, and I am super excited to be your treasurer this year! I'm a junior majoring in Math, and I cannot wait for the coming year of running with MRun. In the words of the immortal Steve Prefontaine:<br /><br />"You have to wonder at times what you're doing out there. Over the years, I've given myself a thousand reasons to keep running, but it always comes back to where it started. It comes down to Rob's amazing treasuring skills. I've been in international competition, and now I know what the big boys can do. You don't go out and just run. You also get to become friends with a huge club of MRunners, especially Rob Rose; he just wants to get to know everyone! Like, he just wants to get to know everyone, whether it is through practice, social events, or even Snapchat (robertrose21)!!! Rob's philosophy is: to give MRun anything less than the best treasuring job ever is to sacrifice the gift. Hey, that's a good quote. Maybe I can adapt that one for myself..." -Steve Prefontaine<br /><br />For some reason I've never seen this quote on the back of a cross country shirt.<br /><br />-r0b</p>

				<p>Yo what up!<br /><br />Your travel coordinator here. I'm a junior, majoring in physics and minoring in computer science. Don't be alarmed if you notice that some people call me The Hammer. If you want a cool nickname like that all you have to do is run a sub 30 second 200m in the first leg of a mile race... simple.  A few of the things I enjoy are MRun, hanging out with my friends (who are all on MRun), and going to MRun practice, oh and coffee. As your travel coordinator, I am in charge everything that has to do with getting to and from meets as well as booking hotels. Get hyped for the meets, because this year we have a lot of really great racing opportunities!! Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.</p>

				<p>What up my playas! <br /><br /> Some people call me J-Kwan, others call me J-Money, one of my homeless friends calls me Big J, and I'm often mistaken for Denzel Washington. I just want you to know two things. First, that the name I was given at birth is John Elliott Holmes III, and second I love MRun and I'm excited to be your distance training chair for the upcoming year. I'm a junior and I love running, I love talking about running, I even love watching running. I'm also a movement science major so if you want to talk about all the scientific aspects of running, hit me up homie. I also aim to please, so if you have a good idea for a workout or new route lemme know and I shall do my best to make it happen. <br /><br /> Love, <br /><br /> John Elliott Holmes III</p>

				<p>Hey all! My name is Tyler Kristoff and I am a junior in the School of Kinesiology majoring in movement science with an emphasis in Pre-Medical studies. As the Sprint/Field Training Chair, I am the one in charge of planning and coordinating workouts  for all those runners who don't like running multiple laps around the track, as well as scheduling the track meets for the Winter. If you like jumping, throwing, running in the fast lane, random dancing, bass drops, or having a great time while running then you may just be a sprinter. I'm excited for the coming year and looking forward to meeting a bunch of new sprinterz.</p>

				<p>Rethink everything you know about S.W.A.G., because it's about to change forever. My goal is to make MRun the best looking group of kids on campus, and quite possibly in the world. Along with being your fantastic S.W.A.G. chair I also double as your official MRun barber, haircuts all around! I'm fully committed to making you guys look as good as physically possible. <br /><br /> (S.W.A.G. stands for SportsWear, Apparel, and Gear)</p>

				<p>Hi everyone! My name is Cassie and I am a sophomore here at U of M. I have always loved running and was so happy to find MRun. I love that through this club I have been able to not only keep improving and competing as a runner, but have had the opportunity to meet many new people and to make lasting friendships. As the Marketing and Fundraising Chair I will be advertising around campus, sending out newsletters, and organizing fundraising events. I hope to increase our membership, keep current members up to date, and raise all of the cashmoney to maximize our club's potential. Any questions or suggestions let me know! :)) </p>

				<p>Hey, everyone! My name is Sarah and I'm a junior majoring in biology. My favorite thing about MRun is being surrounded by athletes who show just as much dedication to helping others as they do on the track.  As community service chair, it's my job to provide volunteering opportunities with organizations like MyTEAM TRIUMPH, Girls on the Run and Relay for Life.  Please email me if you have any comments or suggestions!  I encourage everyone to get as involved as possible, because this is a truly special club that goes beyond the definition of a sports teamâ€”a runner's heart grows strong from training, but an MRunner's heart also grows big from giving back. <3</p>

I'm excited to meet tons of new people this year, so if you're new or I haven't met you feel free to say hi any time! You probably won't hear much from me about the website during the year because it's not something that usually gets talked about, but the fact that you're reading this means that I'm doing OK so far. If you have any ideas or thoughts though, throw them at me and I'll do what I can to make them happen.</p>
