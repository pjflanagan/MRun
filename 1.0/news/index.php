	<h2><u>Don't forget to pack your SOS for Nationals!</u></h2>
	<p>With NIRCA Track & Field Nationals this weekend, make sure you're properly hydrated for all of your events!<p>

	<u><strong>Sprinters:</strong></u>
	<p>Sip some SOS starting about an hour before the prelims - this will help you ward off leg cramps throughout the day. Between rounds, keep drinking SOS - the citrate buffers lactic acid, the sodium keeps you hydrated for longer, and potassium and magnesium will aid muscle contraction and prevent fatigue. Plus, drinking SOS throughout the day will make sure you feel hydrated while you wait for your events.</p>

	<u><strong>Middle and Long Distance Runners:</strong></u>
	<p>Start sipping SOS about an hour before the gun goes off. Don't worry about feeling too full during your race - the ingredients in SOS will help you absorb water faster than just drinking water alone, so it won't be sloshing around in your stomach. Start drinking SOS immediately after your event so you can rehydrate, replace your lost electrolytes, and recover as quickly as possible.</p>

	<u><strong>Half Marathoners:</strong></u>
	<p>Like the track athletes, start sipping on SOS about an hour before the race. There will be plenty of spectators at the 4mi mark to hand you SOS, but remember not to take SOS when you're taking an energy gel. You're going to be exhausted after the 13.1mi race, so make sure to drink plenty of SOS afterwards. It'll help you recover from the hilly course, allowing you to cheer on all the track athletes during the afternoon (or run a track race if you're that ambitious!).</p>

	<h2><u>New for 2015: MRun is partnering with SOS Rehydrate</u></h2>
	<p>We're incredibly excited to announce that SOS Rehydrate has chosen to sponsor MRun! Whether you're an avid runner or new to the sport, you'll appreciate the science behind the company's product.</p>

	<u><strong>What is SOS?</u></strong>
	<p>SOS is a hydration powder that helps combat dehydration by quickly replacing electrolytes. SOS is unique because it has 50% more electrolytes and 75% less carbohydrates than most sport drinks, allowing you to better hydrate to maximize your performance.</p>

	<u><strong>What's in it?</u></strong>
	<p>SOS is packed with the right mix of ingredients your body needs to stay properly hydrated. <strong>Sodium</strong> enables muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. It's the main electrolyte lost through sweat, so it's an essential ingredient. <strong>Potassium</strong> helps the heart and kidneys function and prevents muscle cramping. <strong>Magnesium</strong> helps more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body that specifically help your heart, muscles, immune system, and energy creation. <strong>Citrate</strong> controls the acidity in your body and prevents cramping and fatigue. <strong>Chloride</strong> is needed by the body for many metabolic processes and, along with sodium, is easily lost through sweat. Lastly, <strong>sucrose</strong> and <strong>dextrose</strong> are two sugars that, in the proper amount, help the water absorption process and provide a constant and healthy energy source.</p>

	<u><strong>Who uses SOS?</u></strong>
	<p>As SOS proudly states, "SOS is used daily by Olympians, professional sports teams and athletes, weekend warriors, and literally anyone with an active lifestyle." SOS sponsors dozens of athletes, running clubs, and events, including the <strong>Nike Oregon Track Club - Elite</strong> and the <strong>Michigan Track Classic</strong>.</p>

	<u><strong>How do I take it?</u></strong>
	<p>It's simple: just mix one packet with a bottle of water. If you're a first time user, try making your drink a little weak. It may taste a slightly salty at first, but you'll start craving the flavor after just a single use.</p>

	<u><strong>Still have questions?</u></strong>
	<p>Check out their website: <a href="http://sosrehydrate.com">SOSRehydrate.com</a>. They have great nutritional information and frequently blog about all of the benefits that SOS has to offer.</p>
	<p>We're glad that everyone who came to the workout had a chance to try SOS. Don't forget that we have plenty of coupons good for $1 off a box, redeemable at Meijer.</p>
