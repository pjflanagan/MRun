    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Race Across Michigan</h1>
    <p>The Race Across Michigan (RAM) is an annual event held by the University of Michigan Running Club (MRun) to raise money for the Special Olympics. The runners start at 6:00 in the morning on the Detroit river, and they take turns running the 182 miles across the state of Michigan. The runners will run a total of nearly 24 hours to finish in South Haven, on the coast of Lake Michigan. Leading up to the event, the participants engage with Special Olympics athletes and raise donations for Special Olympics Michigan to support this incredible organization.</p>
    <p>If you want to donate by cash or check, make checks payable to "Special Olympics"</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Relay for Life</h1>
    <p>The Running Club participates in the U of M Relay for Life, a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society held at Palmer Field in April of each year. The idea is for every team to have someone walking around the track at all times, but naturally, as a running club, we run around the track for all 24 hours! In 2011, we walked/ran 530 miles in 24 hours. And while not running, we are singing karaoke, competing in basketball and dodgeball tournaments, and generally having a grand old time. For our spirit and dedication to the event, we have received the Most Spirited Team Award at Relay for Life in 2008, 2009, and 2010. But most importantly, through Saturday-night bake sales, on-site fundraisers (pie in the face, anyone?) and individual fundraising, we have raised over $10,000 for cancer research through the years.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Nationals Shoe Drive</h1>
    <p>MRun hosts an annual shoe drive at the NIRCA Cross Country National Championships meet. We arrange for running clubs from across the country to bring old shoes with them to the meet and have them donated to local homeless shelters. We have a friendly competition between the clubs to see who can donate the most shoes. Since the program's inception in 2008, we have put hundreds of pairs of shoes on needy feet.</p>
