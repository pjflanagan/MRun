    <h2>John Holmes</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a senior studying Movement Science and do a little physics on the side. I'm always looking to get a good run in and make some new friends. As President for the 2015-2016 school year, I'll be making sure that the club operates smoothly and making sure your MRun experience is as good as it possibly can be. While MRun is first and foremost a running club, we also take part in community service and hold social events. MRun has something to offer for everyone so if you've got any questions about the club or just wanna talk about running, let me know!</p>

    <p>Hey guys!</br>
    My name is Jenn, your Marketing and Fundraising chair! As your get to know me, you'll soon learn that I'm really into music, especially hip-hop. I'm from Chicago, and am a sophomore interested in business. So feel free to talk to me about anything, especially running! I love this club, and I want people at Michigan to also realize how great it truly is - whether you are into competition or you just want a group to run and chill with. I'm sure you will see me around campus posting flyers to help more people come to the same conclusion. When you find that MRun is right for you, you'll also have plenty of opportunities to work with me and raise money for our sport so we can go on fun and cheap trips! Yay for dolla billz</p>

I'm a junior in the School of Kinesiology majoring in Movement Science who loves being outside, hanging out with friends, anything to do with running, and all things MRun! Part of my job is creating workouts, picking runs, and helping schedule races. I look forward to an amazing season full of hard work, fast times, and most importantly fun with the the best club on campus!!

    <h2>Tyler Kristoff</h2>
    <p>Hey all! My name is Tyler Kristoff (but you can call me Coach K) and I am a pre-med senior in the School of Kinesiology majoring in movement science with a minor in biochemistry. As the Sprint/Field Training Chair, I am the one in charge of planning and coordinating workouts for all those runners who don't like running multiple laps around the track, as well as scheduling the track meets for the Winter. If you like jumping, throwing, running in the fast lane, random dancing, bass drops, or having a great time while running then you may just be a sprinter. I'm excited for the coming year and looking forward to meeting a bunch of new sprinterz.</p>

    <h2>Emily Furuichi</h2>
    <p>Hiii! My name is Fooch, but a few people call me Emily. My initials spell ELF and I am coincidentally short, so that's something. I am a senior studying movement science in the School of Kinesiology. Some of my favorite things include playing soccer, hanging out with friends, Starbucks, running, MRun, half marathons, and puppies. As community service chair, I will provide volunteering opportunities through multiple organizations such as Girls on the Run, MyTEAM TRIUMPH, and Relay for Life. Community service is just one aspect that makes our club so awesome and well rounded, so I encourage everyone to get involved. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to email me. The previous service chair once said (while quoting someone else) "a runner's heart grows strong from training, but an MRunner's heart also grows big from giving back."&lt;3</p>
