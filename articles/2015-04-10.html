<h1>Don't forget to pack your SOS for Nationals!</h1>
<p>With NIRCA Track &amp; Field Nationals this weekend, make sure you're properly hydrated for all of your events!</p>
<h3>Sprinters:</h3>
<p>Sip some SOS starting about an hour before the prelims - this will help you ward off leg cramps throughout the day. Between rounds, keep drinking SOS - the citrate buffers lactic acid, the sodium keeps you hydrated for longer, and potassium and magnesium will aid muscle contraction and prevent fatigue. Plus, drinking SOS throughout the day will make sure you feel hydrated while you wait for your events.</p>
<h3>Middle and Long Distance Runners:</h3>
<p>Start sipping SOS about an hour before the gun goes off. Don't worry about feeling too full during your race - the ingredients in SOS will help you absorb water faster than just drinking water alone, so it won't be sloshing around in your stomach. Start drinking SOS immediately after your event so you can rehydrate, replace your lost electrolytes, and recover as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>Half Marathoners:</h3>
<p>Like the track athletes, start sipping on SOS about an hour before the race. There will be plenty of spectators at the 4mi mark to hand you SOS, but remember not to take SOS when you're taking an energy gel. You're going to be exhausted after the 13.1mi race, so make sure to drink plenty of SOS afterwards. It'll help you recover from the hilly course, allowing you to cheer on all the track athletes during the afternoon (or run a track race if you're that ambitious!).</p>
