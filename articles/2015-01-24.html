<h1>New for 2015: MRun is partnering with SOS Rehydrate</h1>
<p>We're incredibly excited to announce that SOS Rehydrate has chosen to sponsor MRun! Whether you're an avid runner or new to the sport, you'll appreciate the science behind the company's product.</p>
<h3>What is SOS?</h3>
<p>SOS is a hydration powder that helps combat dehydration by quickly replacing electrolytes. SOS is unique because it has 50% more electrolytes and 75% less carbohydrates than most sport drinks, allowing you to better hydrate to maximize your performance.</p>
<h3>What's in it?</h3>
<p>SOS is packed with the right mix of ingredients your body needs to stay properly hydrated. Sodium enables muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. It's the main electrolyte lost through sweat, so it's an essential ingredient. Potassium helps the heart and kidneys function and prevents muscle cramping. Magnesium helps more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body that specifically help your heart, muscles, immune system, and energy creation. Citrate controls the acidity in your body and prevents cramping and fatigue. Chloride is needed by the body for many metabolic processes and, along with sodium, is easily lost through sweat. Lastly, sucrose and dextrose are two sugars that, in the proper amount, help the water absorption process and provide a constant and healthy energy source.</p>
<h3>Who uses SOS?</h3>
<p>As SOS proudly states, "SOS is used daily by Olympians, professional sports teams and athletes, weekend warriors, and literally anyone with an active lifestyle." SOS sponsors dozens of athletes, running clubs, and events, including the Nike Oregon Track Club - Elite and the Michigan Track Classic.</p>
<h3>How do I take it?</h3>
<p>It's simple: just mix one packet with a bottle of water. If you're a first time user, try making your drink a little weak. It may taste a slightly salty at first, but you'll start craving the flavor after just a single use.</p>
<h3>Still have questions?</h3>
<p>Check out their website: <a href="http://sosrehydrate.com">SOSRehydrate.com</a>. They have great nutritional information and frequently blog about all of the benefits that SOS has to offer.</p>
<p>We're glad that everyone who came to the workout had a chance to try SOS. Don't forget that we have plenty of coupons good for $1 off a box, redeemable at Meijer.</p>
