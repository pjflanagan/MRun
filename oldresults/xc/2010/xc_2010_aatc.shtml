On October 30th, individual  members of the Michigan Running Club attended a cross country race hosted by  the Ann Arbor Track Club. The men ran in the collegiate  men’s 8k while the women ran in the collegiate 5k, on a nice course with  rolling hills around Concordia University’s campus. This race was a great  opportunity MRunners to keep their legs in racing shape to prepare for NIRCA  Nationals. MRun grabbed first place for both men’s and women’s teams. Both  individual winners, who finished with phenominal times, were also from the  Michigan Running Club- Mollie Pozolo with a time of 20:02, and Duriel Hardy  with a time of 25:47. <br /><br />
The men’s race was  dominated by the Michigan Running Club. The first twelve men to cross the  finish line were all from MRun, to give the minimum team score of 15 points. Nathan  Peters had another strong performance, with a second place finish and a time of  26:56. Behind him, Ben Treweek (27:55. 43) and Joe Billian (27:55.91) finished  within milliseconds of each other. Finishing right behind this duo and rounding  out the scoring for the men’s team was Charlie Mouch (28:10).<br /><br />
The women’s team also  took first place with a total of 32 points. After Mollie Pozola, the next two  ladies to cross the finish line were Melanie Jackson (4th place,  21:54) and Alaina Vouaux (5th place, 21:54). Followed behind them  were Jane Harness (8th place, 23:41) and Erika Blankenship (14th,  27:45).<br /><br />
