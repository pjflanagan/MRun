<h3>2010 Results</h3>

<h1>Michigan Running Club has strong  representation at Detroit Marathon</h1><br />
<p>Alex Carney  finishes 7th overall in marathon debut</p>
<p><strong><u>Meet:</u></strong> Detroit Free Press Marathon/ Half  Marathon<br />
    <strong><u>Date:</u></strong> October 17, 2010<br />
    <strong><u>Location:</u></strong> Detroit, MI<br /><br />

A handful of MRunners tried their hands at the 13.1 and  26.2 mile distances, with fantastic results.   Six runners conquered the 26.2 mile challenge, four for the first time,  while four raced the half marathon.  The  race included several miles in Canada, and a trip across the ambassador bridge.<br /><br />

Alex Carney sparkled in his marathon debut, finishing 7th  overall in the 3,231 person race.  His  time was 2:43:35, 15 minutes behind the race winner, Jordan Desilets.  Thomas Yeh had a huge improvement, shaving  about ten minutes off his previous best marathon for a time of 2:50:53, good  for 17th place overall.    Garrett Carpenter also improved by ten minutes over his old marathon PR,  finishing at 3:00:48.  Alex’s twin  brother, Kevin Carney, finished in 3:17:42, while Matt Sienkiewicz (3:38:00)  and John Bennett (3:40:39) also successfully completed their first marathon.<br /><br />

Jason Mahakian was the first MRun member to cross the  finish line in the half marathon, finishing 19th overall out of over  8,500 finishers in 1:14:26.  Jimmy Adams  followed closely behind him in 1:16:12.   Matt Harkreader (1:28:12) and Andy Scheffer (1:40:35) both ran strong as  well.  Also of note, two MRun alumni (Bruce  Kaczmarek, 9th in 1:12:42, and Matt Yacoub, 15th in  1:13:40) were in the top twenty overall.<br /><br />

These runners will undoubtedly take a well-deserved rest  before resuming training for NIRCA nationals on November 13.<br /><br />
