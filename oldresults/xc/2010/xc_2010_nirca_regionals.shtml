After a 12 hour car  ride to Minneapolis, the Michigan Running Club showed up ready to run. Because  of the distance, the MRun representation at Regionals was lower than normal.  The Five women and fourteen men who competed in the race described the course  as beautiful: it was cross country ski trail, between lakes, up hills, and  through forests. Men ran an 8K while women ran a 6K. Despite lower numbers of  runners, both of the men’s and women’s teams did very well. The women’s team  came in 3rd place, while the men finished in 4th.<br /><br />
Max Hock continued his  strong season as the first male MRunner to cross the finish line, with a time  of 26:12 and a 5th place finish. Not too far behind him was Alex  Prasad (26:45, 10th place), who has also had a very solid season  thus far. The next two Mrunners to finish, Joshua Lumley and Charlie Mouch,  came in very close together to finish in 30th (27:42) and 35th  (27:45), respectively. Rounding out the scoring contingent for the men’s team  was Ian Prochaska (27:55, 38th).<br /><br />
The women’s team was  led by Christina Capriccioso, who finished in 8th place overall with  an impressive time of 24:56. Soon after her, teammate Laura Weiser finished in  16th place (25:46). Completing the Mrun representation for the women  were Amanda Balk (27:55), Annabelle Schuelke (31:02), and Colleen Wagner  (35:21).<br /><br />

  On Saturday, October 30th,  many MRunners will be trying to keep their racing legs fresh by competing in a  cross country meet hosted by the Ann Arbor Track Club. MRun will then complete  its cross country season at NIRCA Nationals on Saturday, November 13th.</p>
